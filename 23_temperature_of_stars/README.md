# Yandex Practicum project Temperature of stars

## Task 
- predict temperature of stars of different classes
- where each class has own features cluster and own features dependencies.
- training dataset contains 240 samples (40 for each of  6 classes).
- metric RMSE=4500  demanded. 

## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- torch 

## Files 
- temperature_of_stars.ipynb - only project file

## Result
- Several neural networks with a few hidden levels tested and compared. 
- After fine parameters tuning, the best model achieved RMSE=3700 (r2=0.83)
