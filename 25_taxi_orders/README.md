# Taxi orders prediction
Yandex Practicum time series sprint 25

## Task
- resample data by  hours
- search for patterns in data
- build and train model to predict number of orders
- RMSE= 48 required


## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy 
- pandas
- sklearn
- lightgbm
- catboost
- maplotlib
- statmodels.seasonal

## Files
- taxi_orders.ipynb - project file


## Result
- the data split on trend, seasonal and residuals
- found peaks or orders by week and days
- sliding widows of different sizes used to generate additional features
- several models trained  and compared 
- graphs of dependence on model parameters plotted
- metric RMSE= 40 achieved
